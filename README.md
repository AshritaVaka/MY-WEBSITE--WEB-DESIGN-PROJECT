# MY-WEBSITE--WEB-DESIGN-PROJECT


## Welcome to the World of Me! üåê
Hey there, fellow developer,Let me give you a quick tour of my little corner of the web.

## Who Am I?
I'm Ashrita, a web design enthusiast and part-time cat whisperer. When I'm not busy convincing my HTML to play nice with CSS, you can find me daydreaming about the next big design trend or binging another crime documentary. Spoiler alert: the culprit is always the silent one.

## My Interests
### Web Design: 
Obviously! I love turning a blank canvas into something visually stunning and functional. It's like being an artist, but without all the messy paint.
### Coding:
HTML, CSS, a dash of JavaScript ‚Äì it‚Äôs like cooking, but instead of food, I make websites. And trust me, they‚Äôre much easier to digest.
### Gaming:
Because who doesn‚Äôt love a good escape from reality? Plus, it‚Äôs the perfect excuse to avoid debugging.
## Skills to Pay the Bills
### HTML & CSS: 
The bread and butter of my web design toolkit. I can make a mean responsive layout that looks good on any device. Your phone will thank me.
### JavaScript:
When I want my websites to do more than just sit there and look pretty. Think of it as the special effects in a movie ‚Äì minus the explosions.
### Graphic Design: 
Because sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand lines of code.
### So, kick back, click around, and enjoy the ride through my digital playground. And remember, if your website isn‚Äôt responsive, neither am I!

### Happy browsing!

### Feel free to tweak this to better match your personal style and the specific details of your skills and interests!
